# Frequently asked questions

## My browser plays the video instead of downloading it

Most recent browsers automatically play a video
if it is a format they know how to play.
You can usually download the video by doing *File > Save to* or *ctrl + S*.

## [alltubedownload.net](https://alltubedownload.net) is too slow

[alltubedownload.net](https://alltubedownload.net) is hosted on a free [Heroku server](https://www.heroku.com/pricing)
so it has low RAM and CPU.

AllTube probably won't switch to a more expensive hosting
because this project does not earn any financial ressources
(although [donations are welcome](https://liberapay.com/Rudloff/))
and you are encouraged to host it yourself.

## alltubedownload.net often says "An error occurred in the applicationâ€¦"

See above.

## Change config parameters

You need to create a YAML file called `config.yml` in the `config/` folder.

See [`config.example.yml`](../config/config.example.yml)
for a list of parameters you can set and their default value.

## Enable audio conversion

In order to enable audio conversion, you need to add this to your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
convert: true
avconv: path/to/avconv
```

You will also need to install `avconv` on your server:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libav-tools
```

## Deploy AllTube on Heroku

Create a dyno with the following buildpacks:

* `heroku/php`
* `heroku/nodejs`
* `heroku/python`

You might also need to add the following config variables:

```env
CONVERT=1
PYTHON=/app/.heroku/python/bin/python
```

Then push the code to Heroku and it should work out of the box.

## I can't download videos from some websites (e.g. Dailymotion)

Some websites generate an unique video URL for each IP address.
When using AllTube, the URL is generated for our server's IP address
and your computer is not allowed to use it.
(This is also known to happen with Vevo YouTube videos.)

There are two known workarounds:

* You can run AllTube locally on your computer.
* You can enable streaming videos through the server (see below).
  Please note that this can use a lot of resources on the server
  (which is why we won't enable it on alltubedownload.net).

## I get a 404 error on every page except the index

This is probably because your server does not have [mod_rewrite](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html)
or [AllowOverride](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/core.html#allowoverride)
is disabled.
You can work around this by adding this to your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
uglyUrls: true
```

## Enable streaming videos through the server

You need to add this to your `config.yml` file:

```yaml
stream: true
```

Note that this can use a lot of ressources on your server.

## Download M3U videos

You need to enable streaming (see above).

## The downloaded videos have a strange name like `videoplayback.mp4`

AllTube can rename videos automatically if you enable streaming (see above).

## Download a video that isn't available in my country

If the video is available in the server's country,
you can download it if you enable streaming (see above).

## Run the Docker image

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 rudloff/alltube
```

## Run Heroku locally

You should be able to use `heroku local` like this:

```bash
sudo APACHE_LOCK_DIR=. APACHE_PID_FILE=./pid APACHE_RUN_USER=www-data \
    APACHE_RUN_GROUP=www-data APACHE_LOG_DIR=. \
    heroku local
```

You might need to create some symlinks before that:

```bash
ln -s /usr/sbin/apache2 /usr/sbin/httpd
ln -s /usr/sbin/php-fpm7.0 /usr/sbin/php-fpm
```

And you probably need to run this in another terminal
after `heroku local` has finished launching `php-fpm`:

```bash
chmod 0667 /tmp/heroku.fcgi.5000.sock
```

## Download 1080p videos from Youtube

Youtube distributes HD content in two separate video and audio files.
So AllTube will offer you video-only and audio-only formats in the format list.

You then need to merge them together with a tool like ffmpeg.

You can also enable the experimental remux mode
that will merge the best video and the best audio format on the fly:

```yaml
remux: true
```

## Convert videos to something other than MP3

By default the `convert` option only allows converting to MP3,
in order to keep things simple and ressources usage low.
However, you can use the `convertAdvanced` option like this:

```yaml
convertAdvanced: true
convertAdvancedFormats: [mp3, avi, flv, wav]
```

This will add new inputs on the download page
that allow users to converted videos to other formats.

## Use other youtube-dl generic formats (e.g. `bestaudio`)

You can add new formats by using the `genericFormats` option,
for example:

```yaml
genericFormats:
    bestaudio: Best audio
```

These will be available on every video page.
